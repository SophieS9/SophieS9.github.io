Based at the [Centre for Genome Enabled Biology and Medicine](http://www.abdn.ac.uk/genomics/), University of Aberdeen, UK, I collaborate with and offer support to researchers analysing sequencing data. Applications include RNA sequencing, genome assembly, microbial community analysis and variant calling. I also coordinate and assist with a number of workshops, enabling researchers to take more control in their own data analysis.
